Return macOS and Alfred versions

# Introduction

This very straightforward little workflow simply enables you quickly and effortlessly to return the current versions of both macOS and Alfred running on your Mac. It is designed to be used in posts on the [Alfred forums](https://www.alfredforum.com/) (where, when asking for help, you should—but many don't—report both version numbers).

# Important note

Your Automation Tasks need to be updated to at least version 2024.10 for this workflow to work properly.

# Usage

With your cursor correctly positioned where you wish the version numbers to be given simply type the keyword (the default is `vers`) in Alfred:

![vers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6ddbfbc-6366-419b-8d68-a9785d16e8c7)

The following text (amended as appropriate for the version numbers) will then appear at the cursor:

`I am running macOS 15.1.0 and Alfred 5.5.1 (build 2273)`
